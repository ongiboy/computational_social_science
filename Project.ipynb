    "* What is your dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "Our dataset is ready-made data that originates from The Movie Database (TMDB) via its API. The data is collected from the \"Popular People\" tab on the webpage, and includes the top actors from the first 250 pages, with each page containing data for 20 actors. The popularity score attributed to actors by TMDB is a metric not publicly disclosed, but it's generally understood to consider factors like page views, favorites, watchlists, and recent activity.\n",
    "\n",
    "The data is structured into two main dataframes: one for actors and their attributes (name, ID, gender, age, birthplace, and filmography), and another for movies featuring these actors (rating, popularity, genres, release date, and abstract for text analysis). This setup forms the basis for our actor collaboration network and analysis, which is essential for answering our research question: Based on collaborations among the most popular actors, do distinct communities form, and if so, what characterizes the most succesful communities?\n",
    "\n",
    "* Why did you choose this/these particular dataset(s)?\n",
    "\n",
    "The reason for us choosing The Movie Database (TMDB) as the data source for our project is because of our interest in exploring and analyzing the film industry by an actor collaboration network. TMDB has a broad coverage of the film industry and it has built a reputation for being a well-known data source within the field. TMDB is widely recognized for its movie-related data, containing details on actors, movies, genres, ratings, popularity etc.. The rate limit for the API (50 calls per second) was also an attractive factor. \n",
    "\n",
    "It was therefore believed that through TMDB's API, it would be possible to access up-to-date and reliable data on popular actors and their participation in movies, enabling us to explore actor interactions and movie trends effectively. In this way the TMDB datasource can be used to contribute valuable insights to the broader understanding of the film industry landscape.\n",
    "\n",
    "* What was your goal for the end user’s experience?\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of this project for the end user's experience was to provide insights into the characteristics and dynamics of successful actor communities. By analyzing data from popular actors and their collaborations in a network, we sought to offer a user-friendly interface for exploring trends, identifying influential factors, and gaining a deeper understanding of what drives success in the film industry in an actor perspective.\n"

    "## 2. Basic stats\n",
    "* Write about your choices in data cleaning and preprocessing\n",
    "\n",
    "Using the TMDB API it was possible to retrieve information about popular actors just by using an API-key and selecting the desired number of pages with 20 actors in each page. 250 pages were chosen as a reasonable amount, which in theory would lead to a raw dataset consisting of 6000 actors, but in practice ended up being 5564 actors. This would be the first dataframe \"df_actors\". Since it wasn't possible to use filters directly in the API-call, data processing was performed after the data was collected. The information about these actors that was collected were the attributes: name, id, gender, birthday, place_of_birth and popularity. In this project the focus is on recent actors, and therefore actors who passed away before 2010 are not part of the dataframe.\n",
    "\n",
    "Initially, all rows with missing values in the attributes of interest were removed and duplicate rows were removed. Since all the collected information about the actors is crucial for the analysis, this seemed a reasonable part of the cleaning. \n",
    "\n",
    "Using the retrieved actor IDs, it was now possible to get a complete list of the movies that each actor has played a role in as well as the movie ID - again using the TMDB API. This also laid the foundation for the second dataframe \"df_movies\" with the purpose of being our own little movie-database containing information about all the movies that the actors in the \"df_actors\" dataframe have been part of. Before any processing, the dataframe included 67587 movies.\n",
    "\n",
    "With yet another API call using the found movie IDs, the desired information could be obtained, which consisted of the attributes: rating, popularity, genres, release date and movie abstract. After retrieval of movie information in the movies dataframe, all rows with missing values in any of the attributes were removed. Furthermore, it was decided for this project to only focus on \"recent\" movies, which in this case is defined as movies from 2010 and until the date of collection (08-05-2024). This way, the resulting data was used to generate a network of today's collaboration among popular actors, rather than a network with old data from many decades ago. After this processing the movie dataset consisted of 26494 movies.\n",
    "\n",
    "The outfiltered movies in the movies dataframe, were also removed from the actor dataframe, so the two dataframes would be consistent. After this filtering, actors with an empty movie list were removed, which cut down the number of actors to exactly 5100 in the actors dataframe.\n",
    "\n",
    "Through further investigation of the actors dataframe, it was found that the \"birthplace\" column needed processing. Firstly, the birthplace was reduced to only include the country of birth for the actors, but it was also found that the same countries were spelled differently. The country could be in different languages, symbols, etc., which could introduce misleading findings. The birthplace column was normalized so there would be no double instances of a country of birth. \n",
    "\n",
    "It was in our interest to select a main genre for each actor. Each movie has a list of given genres, and by finding the genre that appeared the most in the movies that the actor has been part of, a main genre for an actor was found. One issue that had to be adressed was regarding the \"Drama\" genre, where the problem was that a significant amoutn of movies were partially catogarized as \"Drama\". The internet defines the drama genre as movies that invokes emotion and features character development, which could characterise almost all movies. To overcome this challenge without removing the drama genre entirely, the drama category is removed from the genre list if there is more than 1 other category. In this way it is avoided that all actors would be \"Drama\" actors. \n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, from the TMDB API there is no direct actor rating measure, which gave us the idea to create our own measure. This measure was created as the mean of the ratings from all the movies the actor has acted in, of the more recent movies (2010-2024). \n",
    "\n",
    "Now that the data had been cleaned and preprocessed, it was time to create the actual network. The edges of the network were weighted by the number of times two actors had collaborated. This led to a very dense network, filled with cliques, since every movie creates a fully-connected clique containing the starring actors. Therefore a threshold of 2 movies was set, so that there would only be an edge if the actors had collaborated at least twice. This both drastically reduces the amount of cliques and makes the network less dense. The final network consisted of the 5100 actors/nodes with 23736 edges. In the network there are 1680 isolated nodes, which refers to popular actors who have been part of movies since 2010, but not with anyone in this network. The largest component of the network consists of 3341 nodes and the network has a density of 0.0018. \n",

    "## 3. Tools, theory and analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "* Describe which network science tools and data analysis strategies you’ve used, how those network science measures work, and why the tools you’ve chosen are right for the problem you’re solving.\n",
    "\n",
    "Degree analysis: \n",
    "\n",
    "In the first part of the network analysis, the focus is on node degrees. The degree of a node is the amount of edges that a node has in the network. Since this network is a undirected network, a weight can be added to the edges, so that the same edges are still counted multiple times. The degree distribution is found and illustrated to see whether the distribution is heavy-tailed, meaning that most nodes have few connections in the network and that there are hubs with a significantly degree than the average and median of the network. \n",
    "\n",
    "Regime:\n",
    "\n",
    "Looking into which regime the network belongs is an important analysis for understanding and characterizing the network. By doing simple calculations the regime and characteristics that follow can be determined. \n",
    "\n",
    "Visualization of the network:\n",
    "\n",
    "More realizations about the network can be obtained by simply visualizing the network. Firstly, the naturally formed communities and the specific hubs in the network can be identified by sizing the nodes by degree. Furthermore, the nodes can be colored according to a specific node attribute, e.g. country of birth, to see whether there are any connections in the network based on this attribute. \n",
    "\n",
    "Assortativity:\n",
    "\n",
    "The assortativity measure refers to the tendency of nodes to link to other nodes with the same (or similar for numeric values) attribute values, such as degree, age, gender etc. The assortativity coefficient ranges from -1 (perfect disassortative) to 1 (perfect assortative). A positive assortativity means that nodes with similar attribute values tend to connect, and a negative assortativity coefficient means that nodes with dissimilar values tend to form connections. As an example if the assortativity attribute is gender, in a perfect assortative network males would only connect to other males, and in a perfect dissasortative network males would only connect to females (in binary gendered network). \n",
    "\n",
    "Closeness/eigenvector centrality:\n",
    "\n",
    "The closeness and eigenvector centrality measure is used to identify the most central nodes in the network. The most central nodes according to the closeness measure, are the nodes that have the longest reach within the fewest edges in the network. Information can flow through these nodes to any other nodes in the network through the shortest possible paths.\n",
    "On the other hand, the eigenvector centrality measure identifies nodes that are not just central because they are connected to many other nodes, but because they are connected to other nodes that are highly connected. \n",
    "These measures can be used in the actor network to identify the most influential actors. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* How did you use the tools to understand your dataset?\n",
    "Degree analysis:\n",
    "\n",
    "After the network was created, the degrees of the nodes in the network were investigated. The average, median, mode, minimum and maximum degree were computed for both the weighted and unweighted network. Furthermore, the degree distribution of the unweighted network is plotted. These metrics and illustrations give an understanding of whether the network contains hubs (nodes with significantly more edges) and whether the network is heavy-tailed distributed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, the highest degree nodes were found. The top 5 actors with highest unweighted degree illustrate the popular actors that have most unique collaborations, where the weighted degree illustrates the popular actors with with most collaborations in the popular actor network, this being both unique and non-unique collborations. By looking the at most repeated edges (edges with highest weight), the \"best friends\" of the network were found. \n",
    "\n",
    "Regime:\n",
    "\n",
    "To get a better overall understanding of the characteristics of the actor network, the regime that this network falls into was found through some simple calculations. By calculating the average degree and comparing it to the logarithm to the number of nodes in the network, it was found that the network falls into the connected regime. This means that most actors in the network are connected in one giant component. \n",
    "\n",
    "Visualization:\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that it is known that the network is connected, the network could be further analyzed by visualizing the network. Using the Netwulf package the network was visualized and the actors were colored according to their birthplace and the node size was set according to their weighted degree. In this way, it was possible to see whether interesting clusters could be found within the network. \n",
    "\n",
    "Assortativity:\n",
    "To further analyze the network and understand the patterns, the specific node attributes were at focus. Calculating the assortativity for the most central node attributes, could give insights into whether these attributes influence the formation of groups within the network. The attributes in focus were the numeric attributes: degree, age, rating and popularity, and the categorical: genre, birthplace and gender. \n",
    "\n",
    "Closeness/eigenvector centrality:\n",
    "The closeness and eigenvector centrality is used in our network analysis to identify the most central actors in the network. Calculating both measures provides a better overview of central nodes, not only in terms of ability to quickly reach other nodes, but also in terms of their influence based on connections to other central actors. \n",
    "\n",
    "* Talk about how you’ve worked with text, including regular expressions, unicode, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "The text data of our project consists of short movie abstracts (average length of around 50 words). The first step was to clean and tokenize the abstracts. We do this with our tokenize_and_clean function, which standardize the text in terms of excluding symbols, numbers and punctuation and converting everything to lowercase. After the cleaning the text gets tokenized, the tokens get stemmed and the English stop-words are removed. A new column in the movies dataframe is created, called “tokens” which is a list of tokens for each movie abstract. As it is of interest to address potential collocation issues, bigram work is done to consider words together that tend to appear together more often than by chance, to retain their original meaning. This is done by extracting all unique bigrams from the tokens column that is exploded, and then comparing the observed contingency table with the expected contingency table. To determine if two words are a collocation a Chi-Squared test is used. Then for each pair of bigrams in the unique bigrams list if the bigram has a frequency above 10 and a p-value from the test under 0.001, it is put into a collocation dictionary. The reason behind this relatively low frequency threshold is because of the short sizes of the abstracts, as if higher too many collocations were filtered out. The tokens are then recomputed with the tokenize_and_clean function, but the tokenizer now considers the collocations, and binds the two words with an underscore. \n",
    "\n",
    "After partitioning the network into communities it is of interest to characterize and identify communities through text analysis, such as TF-IDF based word-clouds. A high TF-IDF value is a good measure to base the word-clouds as it will make the words that stand out in a specific community or topic are emphasized in the word cloud, providing insights into the distinctive language and themes within that community. It is only computed for the top 9 communities in terms of average rating, as these are the only ones to be visualized through the word-clouds. Therefore the IDF is computed for each term unique term in the abstracts of the top 9 as the logarithm of the ratio between the total number of abstracts in the top 9 communities and the number of abstracts containing the term. And the TF is then the frequency of the terms in the 9 communities. By doing so each term and the associated TF-IDF value of the top communities are collected in a dictionary, for our community analysis.\n",

This suggests that actors born in the same country are more likely to collaborate. The value of 0.47 makes sense, as movies of recent times typically features a diverse cast from different nations, implying that actors will not exclusively work with those from their own country. The genre assortativity is also positive at 0.34, again meaning that actors that work on similar types of movies are more likely to collaborate. Since the popular actors network has a gender assortativity close to 0, the connections and clusters are formed independently from gender. \n",

    "\n",
    "In the first 2 rows of the plot above, the community attributes are plotted vs the rating and popularity. Here, it is seen that age has no significant impact on success, as the horizontal line is within the confidence interval. Also, the (Spearman's) correlation is very low. Both genre and birthplace seems to have an effect on performance. (Note that no confidence interval is shown when there is only one datapoint for a category).\n",
    "Although there is a very limited sample size, Japan and Korea seems to perform (significantly) better than many of the other countries in rating. Strangely, in popularity, these two countries seem to underperform while it's the U.S. that performs the best in this metric.\n",
    "\n",
    "These two metrics do not encapsulate the success of a community, or an actor, for that matter. And in some cases, they seem to be directly opposite, as Japan has the highest mean rating but lowest mean popularity, which means that they are extremely liked but only for a small audience. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Success**\n",
    "\n",
    "Because of these result differences in popularity and rating, a new target measure is made: \"success\". This is made by standardizing rating and popularity and multiplying them. This way, the prior two metrics are combined, so a community only has a high success-score if it has both a high rating and a high popularity. The popularity score is plotted in the 3rd row in the plot above.\n",
    "\n",
    "Again, age has no significant impact on success. And because each community's success is now weighted by multiple factors, countries like Japan and U.S. are performing less confidently in rating and popularity, respectively. Now, no single country or genre seems to be performing far better than the others, but there are still some countries (Japan, UK, Korea, U.S. and Australia) that seem to perform better than the rest.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**To summarize the result**, when looking at rating or popularity in isolation, some countries and genres seem to perform significantly better than many of the others. So, if the goal is to become highly rated, the plan would be to move to Japan and make animated movies. And if you want to become popular, you should move to an english speaking country and stay away from TV movies and animation.\n",
    "However, if you want to be \"successful\" (i.e. be both popular and highly rated), there is no single plan that \n",
    "leads to a significantly more successful acting career. There are only a group of countries that would benefit you more, and certain genres that are more promising, on average."

    "* ### What went well?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Community success**\n",
    "\n",
    "The reason for investigating the attributes for successful and unsuccessful communties rather than for the actors is to give the most useful instructions in how to succeed in an acting career. As a young aspiring actor, you can't actively change your age or birthplace, but you can change who you collaborate with, and ultimately which community you most likely end up in. The final result, although not statistically significant, showed a strategic path that increases the chance of a successful acting career.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Communty forming**\n",
    "\n",
    "It was also found that the communities formed based a lot on type of movie. Some were superhero communities, while others were for cartoons, wrestling, or japanese animation. The assortativity for attributes such as genre, rating and birthplace was found to be significantly positive, which means that nodes also tend to cluster based on those attributes. However the communities seemed to form mostly based on movie type.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* ### What is still missing? What could be improved? Why?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Generalizing in communities**\n",
    "\n",
    "A fair question would be whether the generalization of the communities was too harsh. For example, in this project, a community would be categorised as Japanese if there were 34% japanese, 33% US, and 33% UK. An example of this was also seen with Benedict Cumberbatch in the Marvel community. In this case, generalizing a community birthplace is not the most accurate method, and could skew the resulting conclusions. However, the assortativities were calculated for the different attributes, and across many of them, the assortativity was significantly positive which means that generalizing across these attributes is not super unreasonable. \n",
    "Alternatively, as a solution, the birtplace distribution could be expressed for each community, and the same thing could be done for genre. This could futhermore open up for questions such as \"Does diversity among actor nationality increase the success of a community?\".\n",
    "\n",
    "**Data collection and bias**\n",
    "\n",
    "The data collected about the most popular actors from TMDB reveals notable biases which should be considered when interpreting the results of this project. It was observed that there was a significant imbalance in the actor nationalities, as over 50% of the actors in our network originated from the US, while the second most represented nationality is the United Kingdom which only accounted for 13% of the total actors. This is showing a bias towards American actors for the most popular actors within TMDB. This bias in the nationality representation among actors could be due to various reasons, such as the geographical focus of TMDB’s user base, the language dominance of English in the film industry, and the popularity of Hollywood productions on the platform. But it's important to address that this bias may skew analyses and conclusions drawn from our data, especially concerning those related to nationality or culture. \n",
    "\n",
    "Likewise, the distribution of main genres among actors is also very uneven. Comedy genre was representing 35% of the actors’ main genre in movies they acted in while other genres had a much lower representation percentage. This can again affects the drawn conclusions and could also be tackled by focusing on diversifying data sources.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Bigger dataset for significant results**\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the shortcomings of this project is the final amount of communities and attributes. This leads to very scarce plots and no significant impacts in success. \n",
    "To solve this shortcoming, simply scraping more data with the API or using more sites and APIs could be done. This would increase the data size and could reduce the bias but would also increase the running time. It would also lead to more datapoints in the final results, which could lead to more meaningful conclusions.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Variable dependency**\n",
    "\n",
    "For future work, it could be interesting to look further into the attributes and how they contribute to success in terms of rating and popularity. However, Korean love stories might be considered generally good where American love stories might be less successful. The different combinations of attributes and their dependence on each other is something that this project has not explored but could be an idea for future work. This could be done by plotting multiple attributes at a time e.g. through heatmaps, where the color illustrates success, and the attributes are on the axes.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Natural Language Processing**\n",
    "\n",
    "The natural language processing was done on somewhat short abstracts of each movie, averaging less than 50 words. Some of them were around 10 words, and some were even in other languages than english. To tackle these challenges, other sites could be scraped for longer and english-languaged abstracts. Alternatively, the foreign languaged abstracts could be translated with a package before doing the stop-word removal and tokenization.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Further development and analysis**\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, a (very) short description is made of possibilities for further development and analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Network through time.** The collaborations could either be time stamped for analysis across time or an entirely new network could be created - both scenarios expanding to also incorporate movies before 2010.\n",
    "* **Viewer sentiment analysis.** Viewer reviews could be scraped from the internet to make a sentiment analysis. Here, the user sentiment could be done across different genres, ages or countries. \n",
    "* **Expanding the network.** Looking at more actors, so it's not only the collaboration between popular actors, but all actors in general. This would change the fact that now, if someone only collaborates with unpopular actors, they will have 0 links. "
